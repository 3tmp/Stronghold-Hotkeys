# Stronghold utilities

## How to use
To use the program, download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and just double click the `Stronghold.ahk` file.

This adds a little green icon in your system tray. To close the program go to the green icon -> right click -> Exit

In Stronghold you can now press and hold down the middle mouse button and it automatically clicks where your mouse is. Clicks are sent until you release the button again.

## Why?
In Stronghold and Crusader it can get very anoying to make dozens of clicks for just selling stuff or recruiting troups.

## Autoclicker
This program adds an auto clicker. Just press and hold the middle mouse button to send clicks to the game.

## Map navigation (only Stronghold by default)
In Stronghold it is possible to navigate the map with the arrow keys, the [Unofficial Crusader Patcher](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io/) adds the option to navigate with the `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys.

This program now adds the ability to navigate the map in Stronghold.

> **Warning**  
> This makes the a, s, d, f keys impossible to use in any other way (e.g. when saving the game)

### Toggle Map navigation
A Hotkey can be set to toggle the Map navigation on and off.  
This option is disabled by default.

### How to enable map navigation in Crusader?
If you do not have the Crusader Patcher installed, but want to enable the map navigation, just change the group to `StrongholdAndCrusader`.
