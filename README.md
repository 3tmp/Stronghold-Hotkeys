# Stronghold Hotkeys

Supported Stronghold versions are Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader, Stronghold Crusader Extreme

## How to use
To use the program, download and install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and just double click the `Stronghold.ahk` file.

If you want to use a pre built version, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/3tmp/Stronghold-Hotkeys/releases/).

This adds a Stronghold icon in your system tray. To close the program go to this icon -> right click -> "Exit"

In the game you can now press and hold down the middle mouse button and it automatically clicks continously where your mouse is. Also a map navigation with the `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys can be used to navigate the map, as well as some shortcuts to perform actions (like opening the market).

## Change settings
To change any settings, go to the icon -> right click -> "Configure Settings" and change the settings in the gui

## Why?
In Stronghold and Crusader it can get very anoying to make dozens of clicks for just selling stuff or recruiting troups.

Also having to press ctrl + m instead of just m to open the market is inconvenient.

## Autoclicker
This program adds an auto clicker. Just press and hold the middle mouse button (this is the default) to send clicks to the game.

## Map navigation (By default only enabled in Stronghold)
In Stronghold it is possible to navigate the map with the arrow keys, the [Unofficial Crusader Patcher](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io/) adds the option to navigate with the `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys to Crusader. (This is the prefered method for Crusader)

This program now adds the same ability to navigate the map in the game.

> **Warning**  
> This makes the a, s, d, f keys impossible to use in any other way inside of the game (e.g. when saving the game). To mitigate this issue see [toggle key](#toggle-key).

# Replacing keys
To open the market, you can press ctrl + m, to open the barracs you can press ctrl + b, this is inconvenient to use, so this program adds the ability to define a single key to open the market (default setting is m) or may other actions.

> **Warning**  
> This makes the assigned keys impossible to use in any other way inside of the game (e.g. when saving the game). To mitigate this issue see [toggle key](#toggle-key).

### Toggle key
A Hotkey can be set to fast enable and disable the [Map Navigation](#map-navigation-by-default-only-enabled-in-stronghold) as well as the [Replacing keys](#replacing-keys) options during the game.  
This option is set to the `CapsLock` key by default.

# Stronghold minimal Autoclicker

You only need a minimal autoclicker and nothing else?

Just use the file `Minimal_Autoclicker.ahk` and run it, it will enable a simple autoclicker as long as you press and hold the middle mouse button.

If you want to use a pre built version, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/3tmp/Stronghold-Hotkeys/releases/tag/minimal_v1.0).
